This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Todo

- [x] OAuth Provider setup for Github and Google
- [x] Role-based authentication setup for both server rendered pages and client rendered pages
- [x] Admin Role-based authentication
- [ ] Connect to database
- [ ] Validate emails (right now it's more like a username because it can be anything)
